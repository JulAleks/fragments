## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JulAleks/fragments.git
   cd fragments
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setting Up Environment Variables**:
   Ensure you have any required environment variables set up for your project. For example:
   ```bash
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

## Scripts

### Start

This command starts the server normally (without live-reload or debugging):

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the application in production mode using the following:

```bash
node src/server.js
```

By default, the server will run on port 8080. You can access the application at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Dev

To run the server in development mode with **nodemon** (which watches for changes in the `src/` folder and automatically restarts the server when files are updated), use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs the server and watches for changes:

```bash
nodemon src/server.js --watch src
```

### Debug

If you want to start the server and attach a debugger to it, run:

```bash
npm run debug
```

This command runs the server with the **Node.js Inspector** enabled on port `9229` for debugging:

```bash
nodemon --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 src/server.js --watch src
```

You can connect a debugger (e.g., in VSCode or Chrome) to this port.

### Lint

Run ESLint to check your code for issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This runs ESLint on all JavaScript files in the `src/` folder:

```bash
eslint ./src/**/*.js
```

You can also fix linting issues automatically:

```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

## Running the Server

- **Production**: Use `npm start` for production.
- **Development**: Use `npm run dev` to run the server in development mode with automatic restarts.
- **Debugging**: Use `npm run debug` to start the server with debugging enabled.

## Debugging

1. **VSCode Setup**:
   Make sure you have the `launch.json` file set up in the `.vscode` folder. To start debugging:

   - Open **Run and Debug** (`Ctrl + Shift + D`).
   - Select **Debug via npm run debug**.
   - Press **F5** or click **Start Debugging**.

   You can now use breakpoints and inspect the server via the Node.js Inspector running on port `9229`.

2. **Using Chrome DevTools**:

   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect`.
   - Click **Open dedicated DevTools for Node** to connect to the serverâ€™s inspector.

## Notes

- **Ports**:

  - The server runs on port `8080` by default.
  - The Node.js Inspector runs on port `9229` during debugging.

- **Environment Variables**:
  Ensure any necessary environment variables (like `LOG_LEVEL`) are properly configured when running the server or debugging.
